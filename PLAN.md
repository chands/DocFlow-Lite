2. **Document Processing**
   - ✅ Combine multiple images into a single PDF
   - ✅ Convert images to PDF format
   - ✅ Metadata tracking for generated documents
   - ⏳ Split PDFs into individual pages (planned)
   - ⏳ Rotate, reorder, and delete pages (planned)

3. **User Experience**
   - ✅ Responsive design for desktop and mobile
   - ✅ Offline functionality using browser storage
   - ✅ Simple, intuitive UI with minimal learning curve
   - ✅ Dark/light mode support
   - ✅ Progress indicators for document processing

4. **Data Storage**
   - ✅ Client-side storage using IndexedDB via localForage
   - ⏳ Export/import functionality for backup (planned)
   - ⏳ Optional cloud sync (future enhancement)

   - Improved user experience by prioritizing recently uploaded documents

2. **Enhanced Document Viewer**
   - Fixed UI issues with overlapping buttons
   - Improved dialog styling with rounded corners
   - Better mobile responsiveness

3. **Document Generation Improvements**
   - Added metadata to track document sources and generation types
   - Fixed issues with duplicate document creation during merges
   - Improved refresh mechanism after document operations

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Consistent styling across all dialogs
   - Improved progress indicators
   - Better error handling and user feedback

5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Created detailed architecture documentation
   - Documented all components and their usage
   - API documentation for hooks and utilities
   - Feature documentation with usage instructions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Document Processing**
   - OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
   - Document annotation
   - Form filling capabilities
   - Electronic signatures

2. **Collaboration Features**

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**
   - Follow TypeScript best practices
   - Use interfaces for component props and data structures
   - Document code with JSDoc comments
   - Avoid using 'any' type; use proper typing

2. **Component Development**
   - Use Shadcn UI components when available
   - Follow Tailwind CSS mobile-first approach
   - Use Radix UI primitives for complex interactive components
   - Maintain consistent dark/light mode support

3. **Performance**
   - Minimize state updates and side effects
   - Use React.memo for expensive components
   - Implement proper loading states for async operations
   - Use dynamic imports for code splitting when appropriate

4. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use PascalCase for component names
   - Use camelCase for variables, functions, and instances
   - Use kebab-case for directory names
   - Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)

## Conclusion

DocFlow Lite has made significant progress in providing a streamlined, browser-based document management solution that respects user privacy and works reliably offline. The application now offers core document processing features with an intuitive user experience, while maintaining simplicity and performance.

Recent improvements have addressed key usability issues and enhanced the document management experience. The comprehensive documentation created will support future development and make it easier for new contributors to understand the project architecture and codebase.

The foundation built so far will support future enhancements and potential monetization strategies, with a focus on maintaining the application's core principles of privacy, simplicity, and offline functionality.
